# ML Models Directory

This directory stores trained machine learning models for power prediction.

## Contents

- `{device_id}_model.pkl` - Serialized scikit-learn model
- `{device_id}_model_meta.json` - Model metadata (metrics, features, training info)

## Notes

- Models are device-specific (one model per device)
- Models are automatically created by the training endpoint: `POST /api/ml/train`
- Models are gitignored to avoid committing large binary files
- For production, consider using cloud storage (S3, GCS) for model persistence

## Model Lifecycle

1. **Training**: `POST /api/ml/train` creates new model files
2. **Loading**: Models are loaded on-demand for predictions
3. **Retraining**: Overwrites existing model files
4. **Deletion**: `DELETE /api/ml/model` removes files

## File Sizes

Typical file sizes:
- `model.pkl`: 100KB - 10MB (depending on model complexity and data size)
- `model_meta.json`: 1-5KB (JSON metadata)
